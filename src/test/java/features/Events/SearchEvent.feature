Feature: Search Events
  As a user
  I want to search events
  So that I can find events easily

  Scenario: User search event with valid keyword
    Given I launch the browser
    When I navigate to url "https://eventhub.rahulshettyacademy.com"
    Then I verify that "Upcoming Events" is visible successfully

    When I enter "Diwali" in search field
    And I press enter
    Then I should see events related to "Diwali"
